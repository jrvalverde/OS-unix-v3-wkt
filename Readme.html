Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
The `nsys' UNIX kernel was recently donated to the PUPS Archive by
Dennis Ritchie. This file describes how you can boot a slightly-modified
version of this kernel on a 5th Edition RK05 root filesystem.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
Background</A>
</H1>

<P>
In January 1999, Dennis Ritchie sent in a copy of the `nsys' UNIX kernel
for inclusion in the PUPS Archive. In the accompanying README, he says:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So far as I can determine, this is the earliest version of
        Unix that currently exists in machine-readable form. ...
        The dates on the transcription are hard to interpret correctly;
        if my program that interprets the image are correct, the files
        were last touched on 22 Jan, 1973. ...

<P>
What is here is just the source of the OS itself, written in
        the pre-K&amp;R dialect of C.  The file  <TT>u</TT>  is evidently a binary
        image of the kernel.  It is intended only for PDP-11/45, and
        has setup and memory-handling code that will not work on other
        models (it's missing things special to the later, smaller models,
        and the larger physical address space of the still later 11/70.)
        It appears that it is intended to be loaded into memory at
        physical 0, and transferred to at location 0.

<P>
I'm not sure how much work it would take to get this system to boot.
        Even compiling it might be a bit of a challenge, though I imagine
        that circa V5-V6 compilers would handle the language (maybe even V7).
        It is full of <TT>=+</TT> and use of <TT>char *</TT> as unsigned integers,
        and integers used as pointers in locations like <TT>p-&gt;x</TT>.

<P>
So far as I can determine, the disk format it expects is compatible
        with the layout of other earlyish research systems (V5, V6) for
        example. But perhaps not, and it's not certain that the source is
        complete. Even the compilation mechanism is a bit unclear, though
        it certainly used the shell script <TT>ken/rc</TT>, which appears to depend
        on having the *.o files from <TT>ken/*</TT> and <TT>dmr/*</TT> and also
        <TT>slib.a</TT>, which
        doesn't exist on the tape.  My guess is that this was an archive of
        already compiled .o files, so that (for example) to test-build a
        system one would edit a file, compile it, and run <TT>ken/rc</TT> to
        load it.
         The 'ustr' routine referred to in ken/rc evidently stripped off
        the a.out header and the symbols from the a.out file.

<P>
Best wishes with this.  I'd be interested to hear whether anyone gets
        the  <TT>u</TT>  image to run.  If you're in luck, all you need is an
11/45 processor or emulator and a V5/6/7 disk image.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
I decided to try and compile the `nsys' code, and get it to boot on a
PDP-11/45 emulator. A secondary goal was to use the `nsys' compilation
effort to find any remaining bugs in my Apout PDP-11 user-mode emulator.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
Tools Required</A>
</H1>

<P>
Because the `nsys' kernel is dated 1973, I decided to use a 5th Edition
development enviromnent to compile it. This minimised the changes I had
to make to the source code.

<P>
There are several ways you can obtain a 5th Edition development enviromnent:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Load a 5th Edition filesystem on an RK05, and boot it on a
        PDP 11/45;
<LI>Load a 5th Edition filesystem on an RK05 disk image, and boot it
        on a PDP 11/45 emulator; or

<P>
<LI>Unpack the 5th Edition root filesystem tree on a 32-bit little-endian
        Unix system, and use the Apout emulator.
</UL>
<P>
For convenience, I chose to use the Apout emulator (version 2.2alpha8) as
my development environment, and Bob Supnik's PDP-11 simulator (version 2.3d)
as the booting environment. With the latter, I used the 5th Edition RK05
disk image <I>Distributions/research/Dennis_v5/v5root.gz</I> (from the PUPS
Archive) as the filesystem.

<P>
Regardless of the method you choose, the modified `nsys' source must be
unpacked in the directory <TT>/sys/nsys</TT>, relative to the top of the
5th Edition root directory, i.e the file <TT>u</TT> (size 26,266 bytes) becomes
<TT>/sys/nsys/u</TT>. This file is the original `nsys' kernel image, as supplied
by Dennis; we will build our own kernel image.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
Changes to the Nsys Source</A>
</H1>

<P>
Several files in the `nsys' source had to be modified so as the `nsys' kernel
would work with a 5th Edition filesystem &amp; boot environment. The discovery
of these changes took me several days of fiddling with C code, assembly code,
single-stepping machine code, and perusing the Lions' commentary. Email me
if you really want to know the gory details.

<P>
The changes to the ten `nsys' source code files are described below:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Filesystem</STRONG>
<DD>The 5th Edition filesystem is laid out slightly differently
to that which the `nsys' kernel is expecting. The <TT>filsys</TT>
        struct needs an extra field, <TT>s_ronly</TT>, and the <TT>inode</TT>
        struct needs an extra field, <TT>i_lastr</TT>. The two files
        affected are <TT>filsys.h</TT> and <TT>inode.h</TT>.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>C language</STRONG>
<DD>The C language changed slightly from the `nsys' kernel to
        the 5th Edition. Sub-structures defined within a structure were
        delimited by parentheses in `nsys', but by braces in 5th Edition.
        The only file affected is <TT>user.h</TT>.

<P>
Several lines in the <TT>psig()</TT> routine in <TT>ken/sig.c</TT> were
        rearranged because the 5th Edition C compiler refused to parse them.
        The actual operations performed are unchanged.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Device table changes</STRONG>
<DD>The `nsys' kernel is configured to have 
        four block device drivers (rf, rk, tc and tm), and ten
        character device drivers (kl, dc, pc, dp, dn, mm, vt, da, ct, vs).
        To minimise debugging, I chose to remove as many of the drivers as
        possible. I left two block device drivers, rk and tm, and two
        character device drivers, kl and mm. The two main files affected
        were <TT>conf/c.c</TT> and <TT>conf/l.s</TT>.

<P>
The device driver <TT>dmr/rk.c</TT> also had to be modified, as it
        was hard-wired to be block device number 1. It is now block device
        number 0.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Deficiencies</STRONG>
<DD>In the <TT>putchar()</TT> routine in <TT>prf.c</TT>, a test is made
        on a register in the console KL device. This register isn't described in
        my PDP-11 peripherals handbook (dated 1973), and it isn't implemented
        in Bob Supnik's simulator, so I removed the code.

<P>
The declaration of the <TT>clist</TT> struct in <TT>tty.h</TT> need a
        semicolon to end the declaration; again, this could be due to a
        change in the C language.

<P>
The machine code for location 0 in <TT>conf/l.s</TT> has the octal
        value 4 then the instruction <TT>br 1f</TT>. In 5th Edition, these
        two are transposed. It appears that the entry to the `nsys' kernel
        must have been at location 2 (i.e the <TT>br</TT> instruction), whereas
        the 5th Edition kernel starts at location 0. Octal 4 is an IOT
        instruction, which causes an immediate hardware exception on the
        PDP-11. I have transposed these two lines in the `nsys' code.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Cosmetic changes</STRONG>
<DD>While trying to get the `nsys' kernel to boot properly, I added
        the 5th Edition <TT>printf</TT> line to <TT>main()</TT> in <TT>main.c</TT>,
        which outputs the amount of physical memory available on the machine.
</DL>
<P>
As well as these changes, I have moved a few files around so that those
parts of the kernel which must be tailored for each hardware configuration
are kept in the <TT>conf/</TT> directory. Final linking of the `nsys' kernel
is also done in this directory. A few other files have been renamed or
moved, again to tidy up the layout of the source. The changes are:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><TT>dmr/malloc.c</TT> becomes <TT>dmr/mem.c</TT>
<LI><TT>tables.c</TT> becomes <TT>dmr/partab.c</TT>
<LI><TT>ken/45.s</TT> becomes <TT>conf/mch.s</TT>
<LI><TT>ken/low.s</TT> becomes <TT>conf/l.s</TT>
<LI><TT>ken/conf.c</TT> becomes <TT>conf/c.c</TT>
</UL>
<P>
There are several new RCS directories, which hold the changes to the
ten `nsys' files listed above. Finally, three short shell scripts have been
created to make compilation of the `nsys' kernel relatively easy:
<TT>ken/mklib</TT>, <TT>dmr/mklib</TT> and <TT>conf/mkunix</TT>.

<P>

Installing the Nsys Kernel</A>
</H1>

<P>
Now that the `nsys' kernel is compiled, we have to install it in the
root directory of an RK05 5th Edition UNIX root filesystem. I used
the bootable 5th Edition disk image <TT>v5root</TT> and Bob Supnik's
emulator to do this.

<P>
5th Edition UNIX doesn't have <I>tar</I>, so I mounted <TT>v5root</TT> as
RK pack 0, and I mounted the new `nsys' kernel as RK pack 1, after
doing some padding to the file.

Final Notes</A>

<P>
The `nsys' kernel can now boot and run some 5th Edition UNIX a.out binaries.
However, `nsys' is an earlier version than 5th Edition, so there will be
some V5 functionality which `nsys' does not support. In particular, `nsys'
does not have the <TT>pipe()</TT> system call. I have only just got the `nsys'
kernel to boot, so I have not had a chance to sit down and work out exactly
what functionality is missing.
